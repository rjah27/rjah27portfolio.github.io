                <p>Written and illustrated by the late Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball is both a Manga and Anime series
                    that devolves around the story of its protagonist Son Goku. We get to experience almost his entire life
                    starting from his early days as an infant, to where he is a grown adult with an extended family. The adventures and 
                    encounters Goku faces throughout the story each come with an introduction to a new path to who he becomes, and many friends and foes that stick to his side
                    that makes him grow as a person, a fighter, a father, and most importantly a friend. He inevitably becomes the world's signal of hope, as he digs deep down 
                    to find the strength he needs in order to stop chaos and destruction from his home, Earth, though not being from the planet itself. Each time he has to face evil
                    he miraculously knows he can find a way to put an end to it.
